# mdboard

Markdown-based kanban boards for the terminal. Each `.md` file is a board. Cards live under `##` column headings as `###` card titles. Metadata is stored in HTML comments so files stay fully human-readable and git-diffable.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nrand/mdboard
cd mdboard
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

Requires Go 1.22+.

## Board File Format

Boards are plain markdown files. You can edit them by hand at any time:

```markdown
---
board: Project Roadmap
---

## 📋 Backlog

### Design the API
<!-- status: backlog | created: 2026-05-28 -->
- Define endpoints
- Write OpenAPI spec

## 🔄 In Progress

### Build the frontend
<!-- status: in-progress | user: nrand | claimed: 2026-05-28 -->
- SvelteKit setup
- Connect to backend

## 🧪 Testing

## ✅ Done
```

## Config

Config is stored at `~/.mdboard/config.yaml`:

```yaml
github_user: nrand
default_columns:
  - Backlog
  - In Progress
  - Testing
  - Done
```

Customize `default_columns` to change what columns `mdboard new` scaffolds.

## Card Matching

Card titles are matched by **case-insensitive partial string**. So if your card is titled `"Fix authentication token expiry"`, you can refer to it as:

```bash
mdboard claim "auth token"
mdboard move "token expiry" Done
```

If the partial match is ambiguous, mdboard will list all matches and ask you to be more specific.
